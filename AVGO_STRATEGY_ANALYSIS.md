# AVGO Options Strategy Analysis
**Date:** December 12, 2025  
**Scenario:** AVGO down 12% post-earnings (great earnings, AI fear-driven selloff)  
**Outlook:** Expect recovery within 1-2 weeks

---

## PART 1: GENERAL STRATEGY ADVICE

### ✅ **RECOMMENDED: SELLING PUTS** (Best Strategy)

**Why this works:**
1. **Collect Premium:** You get paid upfront (premium comes TO you)
2. **Time Decay Works FOR You:** Options lose value daily, helping your position
3. **Lower Entry if Assigned:** If stock doesn't recover and you get assigned, you buy at a discount
4. **Profit if Stock Recovers:** Put expires worthless, you keep the full premium

**Strategy:**
- Sell cash-secured puts at strikes **5-10% below current price** ($325-$345 range)
- Target **2-3 weeks to expiration** (sweet spot for time decay)
- Only sell if you're comfortable owning AVGO at that price
- Premium collected is yours to keep regardless

**Example:**
- Stock: $361
- Sell $340 Put (6% below) for ~$5 premium = **$500 per contract**
- If stock stays above $340: Keep $500 profit
- If stock drops below $340: You buy 100 shares at $340 (effective cost: $335 after premium)

**Risk/Reward:**
- ✅ Max Profit: Premium collected (guaranteed if stock stays above strike)
- ⚠️ Max Risk: Strike price × 100 - premium (if stock crashes, you must buy)
- ✅ Probability: 70-85% profit (if strike is 5-10% OTM)

---

### ⚠️ **ALTERNATIVE: BUYING CALLS** (Higher Risk, Higher Reward)

**Why this could work:**
1. **Leverage:** Control 100 shares with much less capital
2. **Limited Risk:** Can only lose the premium you pay
3. **Recovery Play:** If stock bounces 5-10%, calls can return 50-200%+

**Strategy:**
- Buy **at-the-money or slightly ITM calls** ($350-$365 strikes)
- Target **1-2 weeks to expiration** (matches your recovery timeline)
- Need stock to move up **enough to cover premium** to profit

**Example:**
- Stock: $361
- Buy $350 Call for $15 premium = **$1,500 per contract**
- Break-even: Stock must be above $365 ($350 + $15)
- If stock recovers to $375: Option worth $25 = **$1,000 profit (67% ROI)**
- If stock stays flat: Lose entire $1,500 (100% loss)

**Risk/Reward:**
- ✅ Max Profit: Unlimited (stock can keep rising)
- ❌ Max Loss: Entire premium paid (can lose 100%)
- ⚠️ Probability: 30-50% profit (need meaningful upward move)

**Key Risks:**
- **Time Decay:** Option loses value daily (especially last week)
- **IV Crush:** If volatility drops, option premiums shrink
- **Direction Required:** Stock must move up significantly to profit

---

### ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED: BUYING PUTS**

- You're bullish, so buying puts (bearish bet) contradicts your thesis
- Would only profit if stock continues falling
- Waste of capital given your recovery expectation

| Strategy | Action | Money Flow | Capital Needed | Max Profit | Max Loss | Best If... |

## RECOMMENDATION RANKING

### 🥇 **#1: SELL PUTS (Best Choice)**

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with your neutral-to-bullish view
- Generates income while waiting for recovery
- Lower risk than buying calls
- Better probability of profit (70-85%)
- If assigned, you own quality stock at discount

**Target Strikes:**
- Conservative: $340-$345 (5-6% below current)
- Moderate: $335-$340 (7-8% below)
- Aggressive: $325-$335 (10% below)

**Target Expiration:** 2-3 weeks out

---

### 🥈 **#2: BUY CALLS (Speculative Play)**

**Rationale:**
- Good if you're very confident in quick recovery
- Higher leverage and upside potential
- Limited risk (only lose premium)

**Target Strikes:**
- Conservative: $350 ITM call
- Moderate: $355-$360 ATM call
- Aggressive: $370-$380 OTM call

**Target Expiration:** 1-2 weeks out

---

### 🥉 **#3: HYBRID APPROACH**

**Rationale:**
- Sell puts for income
- Buy calls with part of premium collected
- Best of both worlds (with more capital)

**Example:**
- Sell 2x $340 puts for $1,000 total premium
- Use $1,500 to buy 1x $350 call
- If stock recovers: Keep $1,000 + call profit
- If stock drops: Own shares at discount + call expires

---

## KEY CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. **Timing**
- If recovery happens in 3+ weeks: Selling puts is better
- If recovery happens in 1 week: Buying calls could be better
- Your 1-2 week timeline favors **selling puts** (more time for premium decay)

### 2. **Capital Requirements**
- Selling puts: Need $34,000+ cash (for cash-secured)
- Buying calls: Need $1,500-$3,000 (much less)
- Consider margin for puts (20-25% of strike)

### 3. **Risk Tolerance**
- Low risk: Sell OTM puts (lower premium, lower risk)
- Medium risk: Sell ATM puts or buy ITM calls
- High risk: Buy OTM calls (cheap but low probability)

### 4. **Implied Volatility**
- High IV (after selloff): Premiums are expensive (good for selling, bad for buying)
- Low IV: Premiums cheap (good for buying, bad for selling)
- Check IV percentile/rank before deciding

---

**For Call Buying:**
- Only risk money you can afford to lose 100%
- Set stop-loss at 50% loss
- Take profits at 50-100% gain (don't get greedy)
- Time decay accelerates in last week

---

### 📈 **MONITORING**

**Daily Checks:**
- Stock price movement
- Option premium changes
- Days to expiration countdown

**Action Triggers:**

**If Selling Puts:**
- Stock drops below strike: Consider rolling or closing
- Profit reaches 70%+: Consider closing early
- 3-5 days to expiration: Close or roll

**If Buying Calls:**
- Stock moves up 3-5%: Consider taking profits
