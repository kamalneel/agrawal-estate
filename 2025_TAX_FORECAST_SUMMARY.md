## Important Notes for Accuracy

### 1. Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA
- ✅ **Traditional IRA**: Reduces AGI (tax deduction)
- ❌ **Roth IRA**: Does NOT reduce AGI (after-tax contribution)
- Your forecast correctly handles this distinction

### 2. Capital Gains Estimation
- Currently using **30% gain estimation** on sale proceeds
- For precise calculation, need:
  - Cost basis for each stock sold
  - Purchase dates (for holding period)
  - Sale dates and proceeds
- **Recommendation**: Implement cost basis tracking for accuracy

### 3. 401(k) Treatment
- 401(k) contributions **already excluded** from W-2 Box 1 (wages)
- No additional AGI adjustment needed
- Correctly handled in forecast

### 4. Investment Income
- Options income ($121,590) is taxed as **short-term capital gains** (ordinary rates)
- Not eligible for preferential long-term capital gains rates
- Subject to NIIT if AGI > $250,000
